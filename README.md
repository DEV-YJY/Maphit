# App name

This app was built as my solo-project. It is a travel photo album app that displays the locations where the photos were taken.

- A user can :
  - Create different albums for different places.
  - Enter the address of the place they visited.
  - Can save photos in their albums.
  - Can check the locations where the photos were taken on       the map.

- All albums are saved in the database.
- All photos are saved in the cloud.
